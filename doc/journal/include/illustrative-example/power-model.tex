At \stage{2}\ in \fref{algorithm}, we need to decide on the power model with the identified uncertain parameters as an input.
To this end, \eref{power-model} is decomposed into the sum of the dynamic and static components denoted by $\oPower{\dyn}{\t, \vU}$ and $\oPower{\stat}{\vTO(\t, \vU), \vU}$, respectively.
As motivated earlier, we let $\oPower{\dyn}{\t, \vU} = \vP_\dyn(\t)$ (does not depend on $\vU$).
We assume that the desired workload of the system is given as a dynamic power profile denoted by $\profilePdyn$.
Without loss of generality, the development of the static part is based on SPICE simulations of a reference electrical circuit composed of BSIM4 devices (v4.7.0) \cite{bsim} configured according to the 45-nm PTM (high-performance) \cite{ptm}.
Specifically, we use a series of CMOS invertors for this purpose.
The simulations are performed for a fine-grained two-dimensional grid, the effective channel length \vs\ temperature, and the results are tabulated.
The interpolation facilities of MATLAB (vR2013a) \cite{matlab} are then utilized whenever we need to evaluate the leakage power for a particular point within the range of the grid, which is chosen to be sufficiently wide.
