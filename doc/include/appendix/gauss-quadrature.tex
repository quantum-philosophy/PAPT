In multiple dimensions, a $\vars$-variate quadrature rule is then a tensor product of one-dimensional counterparts. Define such a multidimensional rule as
\[
  \oQuad{\vars}{\qdlevel}{f} = \sum_{i = 1}^{\qdorder} f(\qdn{\vZ}_i) \qdw_i
\]
 where $f$ is the function to be integrated, $\qdlevel$ denotes the level of the rule, and $\qdorder$ is the number of quadrature points.

Since we need to compute expectations with respect to normal measures, the Gauss-Hermite quadrature rule is of particular interests. The rule is a Gaussian rule; therefore, the order $\qdorder$, \ie, the number of integration points involved, and precision $\qdprecision$, \ie, the maximal total order of polynomials that the rule integrates exactly, are related as $\qdprecision = 2 \qdorder - 1$, which makes such quadratures especially efficient \cite{heiss2008}. Using the family of the one-dimensional Gauss-Hermite rules, a multivariate quadrature is constructed. In low dimensions, the construction is based on the direct tensor produce of the one-dimensional rules; however, in high dimensions, the number of points computed by this technique can easily explode. To overcome the problem, we employ the Smolyak algorithm, which preserves the accuracy of the underlying one-dimensional rules for complete polynomials while significantly reducing the number of integration points \cite{eldred2009, maitre2010, heiss2008}.

Where $\qdn{\vZ}_i \in \real^\vars$ and $\qdw_i \in \real$ are the prescribed integration points and their weights, respectively. The level $\qdlevel$ is defined as the index of the quadrature in the corresponding family of rules with increasing precision; this value should be chosen in such a way that the rule is exact for polynomials of total order at least $2 \pcorder$ (twice the order of the PC expansion), which can be seen in \eref{pc-coefficients} \cite{eldred2009}. Therefore, $\qdlevel \geq \pcorder + 1$ since the quadrature is Gaussian.

Denote then a quadrature-based approximation of an integral of some $\vars$-variate function $f$ by $\oQuad{\vars}{\qdlevel}{f}$, where $\qdlevel$ is the so-called accuracy level of the quadrature rule used. Consequently, we rewrite \eref{pc-coefficients} as
\[
  \pcc{\vP}_i(0) = \frac{1}{\pcn_i} \oQuad{\vars}{\qdlevel}{\vP(0, \o) \pcb_i(\vZ(\o))}
\]
where $\{ \pcn_i \}_{i = 1}^{\pcterms}$ are computed exactly either by directly using the same quadrature rule or by taking products of one-dimensional counterparts with known analytical expressions \cite{xiu2010}; the result is further tabulated.
