The basic idea of our framework is to construct a surrogate model using the theory of polynomial chaos (PC) expansions. Given such a surrogate model, quantities as cumulative distributions functions (\cdfs) and \pdfs\ can be easily estimated. Moreover, the representations which we compute, provide analytical formulae for probabilistic moments, \ie, the expected value, variance, \etc\ are readily available.
