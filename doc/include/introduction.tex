Throughout this article, we use the following notations. $\real$ and $\natural$ are the sets of real and nonnegative natural numbers, respectively. Boldface letters denote vectors and matrices, e.g., $\m{M} \in \real^{n \times m}$ is a $n \times m$ real matrix, and $\v{v} \in \real^n$ is a $n$-dimensional real column vector, respectively. $\m{M}^T$ and $e^\m{M}$ are the transpose and matrix exponential of $\m{M}$, respectively. $\diag{m_i} \in \real^{n \times n}$ denotes a $n \times n$ diagonal matrix. $\mI_n$ is the $n \times n$ identity matrix, and $\mZ_{n \times m}$ is the $n \times m$ zero matrix; we shall omit these indexes when the actual dimensions of $\mI$ and $\mZ$ are clear from the context. Finaly, $\sI_n = \{ 0, \dots, n - 1 \} \subset \natural^n$ denotes the set of first $n$ natural numbers.
