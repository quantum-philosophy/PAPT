In this paper, we presented an UQ framework for the stochastic PTA of multiprocessor systems. Our general technique was then applied in a context of particular importance, wherein the variability of the leakage current due to process variation was addressed. Finally, we drew a comparison with MC sampling, which confirmed the efficiency of our approach in terms of both accuracy and computational speed. The reduced execution times implied by the proposed framework allow for stochastic PTA to be efficiently performed inside design space exploration loops for, \eg, energy and reliability optimization with temperature-related constraints in the presence of process variation.
