In this paper, we presented an uncertainty quantification framework for the stochastic power-temperature analysis of multiprocessor systems. Our general framework was then applied to a particular scenario, wherein the variability of the leakage current was addressed. Finally, we drew a comparison with the Monte Carlo sampling, which confirmed the efficiency of our approach in terms of both accuracy and computational speed.
