In this paper, we presented a framework for the stochastic power-temperature analysis (PTA) of electronic systems under process variation.
Our general technique was then applied in a context of particular importance wherein the variability of the effective channel length was addressed.
We would like to emphasize, however, that the framework can be readily utilized to analyze any other quantities of interest affected by process variation and, moreover, to study their combinations.
Finally, we drew a comparison with MC sampling, which confirmed the efficiency of our approach in terms of both accuracy and speed.
The reduced execution times implied by the proposed framework allow for stochastic PTA to be efficiently performed inside design space exploration loops aimed at, \eg, energy and reliability optimization with temperature-related constraints under process variation.
