In this paper, we presented an UQ framework for the stochastic PTA of multiprocessor systems. The framework is applied for modeling the variability of the leakage current. A comparison with a MC-based technique is drawn, which confirms the superior performance of our approach in terms of both accuracy and computational speed.
