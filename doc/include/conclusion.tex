In this work, we presented a probabilistic framework for uncertainty quantification of temperature and power variations of stochastic multiprocessor systems. Our approach is based on the generalized polynomial chaos, which can easily be extended to other bases adjusting the framework to particular situations. The technique is able to handle different probability laws and correlation structures of the intrinsic uncertain parameters and produces analytical formulations for the resulting stochastic temperature and power trances. The proposed framework is applied to model the variability of the leakage current, which is followed by an assessment of our results with a Monte Carlo sampling technique. The later confirms the superior performance of the proposed framework in terms of both accuracy and computational speed.
