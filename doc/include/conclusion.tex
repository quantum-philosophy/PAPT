In this paper, we presented an uncertainty quantification framework for the stochastic power-temperature analysis of multiprocessor systems. Our general framework was then applied in a particular context, wherein the variability of the leakage current due to process variation was addressed. Finally, we drew a comparison with the Monte Carlo sampling, which confirmed the efficiency of our approach in terms of both accuracy and computational speed.

For the future work, we intent to continue developing the proposed UQ framework and, in particular, to demonstrate its applicability for various design space exploration problems of stochastic multiprocessor systems, wherein the search space has power and/or thermal constraints.
