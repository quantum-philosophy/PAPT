In this paper, we presented an UQ framework for the stochastic PTA of multiprocessor systems. Our general framework was then applied in a context of particular importance, wherein the variability of the leakage current due to process variation was addressed. Finally, we drew a comparison with the MC sampling, which confirmed the efficiency of our approach in terms of both accuracy and computational speed.
