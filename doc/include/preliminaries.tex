Throughout this article, we use the following notations. $\real$ and $\natural{n}$ are the set of real number and the set of integers greater or equal to $n$, respectively. Boldface letters denote vectors and matrices, e.g., $\m{M} = \mtx{m_{ij}} \in \real^{n \times m}$ is an $n \times m$ real matrix, and $\v{V} = \vec{v_i} \in \real^n$ is an $n$-dimensional real column vector. $\m{M}^T$ and $e^\m{M}$ are the transpose and matrix exponential of $\m{M}$, respectively. $\diag{m_i} \in \real^{n \times n}$ denotes an $n \times n$ diagonal matrix. $\mI_n$ is the $n \times n$ identity matrix, and $\mZero_{n \times m}$ is the $n \times m$ zero matrix; we shall omit these indexes when the actual dimensions of $\mI$ and $\mZero$ are clear from the context.

The tuple $(\outcomes, \sAlgebra, \pMeasure)$ denotes a complete probability space \cite{durrett2010} where $\outcomes$ is a set of outcomes, $\sAlgebra \subset 2^\outcomes$ is a $\sigma$-algebra on $\outcomes$, and $\pMeasure: \sAlgebra \to [0, 1]$ is a probability measure induced on the measurable space $(\outcomes, \sAlgebra)$. A $\sAlgebra$-measurable function $\rv{X}(\o): \outcomes \to \real$ is called a \definition{random variable} (r.v.). Denote $\exp_\rv{X} = \oExp{\rv{X}(\o)}$ the expectation of $\rv{X}(\o)$ and $\var_\rv{X} = \oVar{\rv{X}(\o)}$ its variance. A $\pMeasure$-measurable, vector-valued function $\mrv{X}(\o): \outcomes \to \real^n$ is called a random vector with $\vExp_\mrv{X} = \oExp{\mrv{X}(\o)}$ and $\mCov_\mrv{X} = \oCov{\mrv{X}(\o)}$ being its expectation vector and covariance matrix, respectively. A \definition{stochastic process} is a parametrized collection of r.v.'s $\{ \rv{X}(\t, \o) \}_{\t \in \sTime}$ where $\sTime$ is a parameter space, which is usually assumed to be the half line $[0, \infty)$ meaning time. $\{ \mrv{X}(\t, \o) \}_{\t \in \sTime}$ denotes a $n$-dimensional stochastic process.
