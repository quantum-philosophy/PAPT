\subsection{Basic Notations}
Throughout this article, we use the following notations. $\real$ and $\natural{n}$ are the set of real number and the set of integers greater or equal to $n$, respectively. Boldface letters denote vectors and matrices, e.g., $\m{M} = \mtx{m_{ij}} \in \real^{n \times m}$ is an $n \times m$ real matrix, and $\v{V} = \vec{v_i} \in \real^n$ is an $n$-dimensional real column vector. $\m{M}^T$ and $e^\m{M}$ are the transpose and matrix exponential of $\m{M}$, respectively. $\diag{m_i} \in \real^{n \times n}$ denotes an $n \times n$ diagonal matrix. $\mI_n$ is the $n \times n$ identity matrix, and $\mZero_{n \times m}$ is the $n \times m$ zero matrix; we shall omit these indexes when the actual dimensions of $\mI$ and $\mZero$ are clear from the context.

The tuple $(\outcomes, \sAlgebra, \pMeasure)$ denotes a complete probability space \cite{durrett2010} where $\outcomes$ is a set of outcomes, $\sAlgebra \subset 2^\outcomes$ is a $\sigma$-algebra on $\outcomes$, and $\pMeasure: \sAlgebra \to [0, 1]$ is a probability measure induced on the measurable space $(\outcomes, \sAlgebra)$. A $\sAlgebra$-measurable function $\rv{X}(\o): \outcomes \to \real$ is called a \definition{random variable} (r.v.). Denote $\exp_\rv{X} = \oExp{\rv{X}(\o)}$ the expectation of $\rv{X}(\o)$ and $\var_\rv{X} = \oVar{\rv{X}(\o)}$ its variance. A $\pMeasure$-measurable, vector-valued function $\mrv{X}(\o): \outcomes \to \real^n$ is called a random vector with $\vExp_\mrv{X} = \oExp{\mrv{X}(\o)}$ and $\mCov_\mrv{X} = \oCov{\mrv{X}(\o)}$ being its expectation vector and covariance matrix, respectively. A \definition{stochastic process} is a parametrized collection of r.v.'s $\{ \rv{X}(\t, \o) \}_{\t \in \sTime}$ where $\sTime$ is a parameter space, which is usually assumed to be the half line $[0, \infty)$ meaning time. $\{ \mrv{X}(\t, \o) \}_{\t \in \sTime}$ denotes a $n$-dimensional stochastic process.

\subsection{Architecture Model} \slabel{architecture-model} \slabel{system-profiles}
Consider a heterogeneous multiprocessor platform that consists of $\cores$ processing element of any kind and is equipped with a thermal package. The platform is treated as a \emph{thermal system} where the processing elements dissipate power and, consequently, cause temperature changes. Let $\system$ be a \definition{high-level thermal specification} of the system, which includes the following information related to temperature issues:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The floorplan of the die (the location and dimensions of the processing elements). In the case of 3D ICs, the floorplans of each of the stacked chips.
  \item The configuration of the thermal package (the dimensions of each of the layers).
  \item The thermal parameters of the materials that the die and package are made of (the thermal conductivity, specific heat, convection capacitance, and convection resistance).
\end{itemize}
In this work, all the parameters in $\system$ are assumed to be deterministic. The thermal system under consideration also depends on a set of uncertain parameters, which we denoted by $\vU(\o)$ where $\o \in \outcomes$ is an outcome of an appropriate probability space. The uncertainties manifest themselves in the deviation of the actual power dissipation from nominal values and, consequently, in variations of temperature.

In order to quantify the system, we introduce the following definition. A \definition{system profile} $\prof{\m{Q}}$ of a quantity $Q$ over a time interval $\period$ is a tuple $(\part, \m{Q})$ where $\part = \{ 0 = \t_1 < \dotsc < \t_{\steps + 1} = \period \}$ is a partition of $\period$ into $\steps$ subintervals $\{ \dt_i = \t_{i+1} - \t_i \}_{i = 1}^{\steps}$, and $\m{Q} \in \real^{\cores \times \steps}$ is a matrix that captures the values of $Q$ for all $\cores$ processing elements at all $\steps$ time intervals. In particular, we are interested in the power and temperature profiles denoted by $\prof{\mP}$ and $\prof{\mTO}$, respectively (hereafter, $P$ stands for power and $\T$ for temperature). Since the thermal system is stochastic, we shall distinguish between deterministic (nominal) and stochastic power and temperature profiles. In the stochastic case, $\prof{\mP(\o)}$ and $\prof{\mTO(\o)}$ contain r.v.'s.
