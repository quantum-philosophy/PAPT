In brief, we aim to develop a probabilistic framework to perform the temperature analysis of multiprocessor systems, which are exposed to the process variation. The framework should be based on (1) a high-level description of the platform $\system$, (2) a model of the power dissipation as a function of uncertain parameters $\vU(\o)$, and (3) the knowledge of the probability distribution of these parameters. Given a nominal dynamic power profile of the system $\prof{\mP_\dyn}$, the framework should devliver the corresponding stochastic temperature profile $\prof{\mTO(\o)}$ as an analytical expression, which is essentially easy from the perspective of the further analysis. Also, the produced solution is required to have a satisfactory level of accuracy and a low computational cost. Note that \emph{we do not assume any particular distribution or any particular structure of correlations}.
