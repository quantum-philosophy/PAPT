In brief, we aim to develop a probabilistic framework to perform the temperature analysis of multiprocessor systems exposed to the process variation. A high-level description of the platform $\system$ and a model of the power dissipation as a function of uncertain parameters $\vU(\o)$ (further discussed in \sref{power-model}) are assumed to be given. \emph{The r.v.'s $\vU(\o)$ can be correlated and have an arbitrary probability distribution}. The constructed framework takes a nominal dynamic power profile of the system $\prof{\mP_\dyn}$ and a specification of the uncertainties $\vU(\o)$, which, in the simpliest case, is the mean vector $\vExp_\mrv{\vU}$ and covarince matrix $\mCov_\mrv{\vU}$, and delivers the corresponding stochastic temperature profile $\prof{\mTO(\o)}$. We require the framework to produce an analytical expression for $\prof{\mTO(\o)}$, which is essentially easy from the perspective of the further analysis. Also, the solution should have a satisfactory accuracy with a low computational cost.
