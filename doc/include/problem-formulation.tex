In brief, we aim to develop a probabilistic framework to perform the temperature analysis of multiprocessor systems where the actual power dissipation is assumed to be unknown due to the dependency on a set of uncertain parameters. The framework should be based on (1) a high-level description of the platform $\system$ defined in \sref{architecture-model}, (2) a model of the power dissipation as a function (possibly implicit, i.e., a `black box') of the uncertain parameters (\sref{power-model}), and (3) their joint probability distribution (\sref{uncertain-parameters}). Given a nominal dynamic power profile of the system $\prof{\mP_\dyn}$, the framework should devliver the corresponding stochastic temperature profile $\prof{\mTO(\o)}$ in an analytical form, which is essentially easy to be further analyzed. The produced solution is required to have a satisfactory level of accuracy and a low computational cost.
