We aim to develop an UQ framework tailored for the TA of multiprocessor systems where the actual power dissipation is assumed to be unknown due to the dependency on a set of uncertain parameters $\vU(\o)$. The framework should be based on (1) a high-level thermal specification of the platform $\system$ (\sref{architecture-model}), (2) probability laws (marginal distributions) and a correlation structure (a covariance matrix) of $\vU(\o)$ (\sref{uncertain-parameters}), and (3) a model of the power dissipation as a (possibly implicit) function of $\vU(\o)$ (\sref{power-model}). Given a nominal dynamic power profile of the system $\prof{\mP_\dyn}$, the framework should deliver the corresponding stochastic temperature profile $\prof{\mTO(\o)}$, which has a disired level of accuracy and a low computational cost. $\prof{\mTO(\o)}$ is required to have an analytical formulation, which is essentially easy to be further analyzed.
