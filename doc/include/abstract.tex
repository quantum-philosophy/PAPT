A probabilistic framework for quantification of temperature and power variations within stochastic multiprocessor systems is presented. The framework is based on (1) a high-level thermal specification of the platform under consideration, (2) probability laws and a correlation structure of the intrisict uncertain parameters that affect the power dissipation of the processing elements within the platform, and (3) an arbitrary power model, in which the uncertain parameters are inputs. Given a nominal dynamic power profile, the framework delivers analytical expressions for the resulting stochastic temperature and power traces. The expressions are sums of orthogonal polynomials of the uncertain parameters, which makes the stochastic traces essentially trivial for a wide range of subsequent analyses. The computational time and accuracy of our technique are assessed by a Monte Carlo sampling method, which confirms the superior performance of the proposed framework.
