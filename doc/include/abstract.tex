Embedded system designs based on deterministic techniques for power-temperature analysis (PTA) are, in the context of current and future technologies, both unreliable and inefficient since the presence of uncertainty is disregarded. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic PTA framework for exploring multiprocessor systems that depend on uncertain parameters. The framework is able to model diverse probability distributions and joint effects of such parameters on the power and temperature profiles of the systems. Specifically, given a nominal dynamic power trace, the framework construct a light surragate model for the corresponding stochastic power and temperature traces, which is essentially easy for extraction of various statistics such as probabilistic moments, distribution funtions, density functions, \etc\ The computational time and accuracy of our approach are assessed by Monte Carlo simulations, which confirm the efficiency of the proposed technique.
