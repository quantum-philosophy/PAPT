Multiprocessor system design decisions based on deterministic techniques for power-temperature analysis are inherently compromised since the presence of uncertainty is disregarded. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic framework for quantification of power and temperature variations that handles various probability laws and dependency structures of the intrinsic uncertain parameters. Given a nominal dynamic power profile, the framework delivers analytical expressions for the resulting stochastic power and temperature traces without making a priori assumptions about their probability distributions. The computational time and accuracy of our approach are assessed by Monte Carlo simulations, which assert the superior performance of the proposed technique.
