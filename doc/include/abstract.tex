Multiprocessor system design based on deterministic techniques for power-temperature analysis is, in the context of current and future technologies, both unreliable and inefficient since the presence of uncertainty, in particular, due to process variation, is disregarded.
In this work, we propose a flexible probabilistic framework targeted at the quantification of the transient power and temperature variations, which is capable of modeling diverse probability laws of the underlying uncertain parameters and arbitrary impacts of such parameters on the system.
Given a multiprocessor platform under a certain workload, the framework delivers analytical representations of the corresponding stochastic power and temperature profiles.
These representations allow for a computationally efficient estimation of the probability distributions and accompanying quantities, such as moments, probabilities, and quantiles, of the power and temperature characteristics of the system.
The approximation accuracy and computational time of our approach are assessed by a wide range of comparisons with Monte Carlo simulations, which confirms the efficiency of the proposed technique.
