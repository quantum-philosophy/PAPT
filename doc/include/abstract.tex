Deterministic techniques for temperature analysis of multiprocessor systems compromise the reliability of the design decisions since they disregard the essential presence of uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic framework for quantification of temperature and power variations, which handles diverse probability laws and dependency structures of the intrinsic uncertain parameters. Given a nominal dynamic power profile, our technique delivers analytical expressions for the resulting stochastic temperature and power traces without making any a priori assumptions about their probability distributions. The computational time and accuracy of our technique are assessed by Monte Carlo simulations, which assert the superior performance of the proposed framework.
