Multiprocessor system design based on deterministic techniques for power-temperature analysis is, in the context of current and future technologies, both unreliable and inefficient since the presence of uncertainty, \eg, due to process variation, is disregarded. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic framework for quantification of power and temperature variations that handles diverse probability laws and dependency structures of the uncertain parameters. For a given system under a cirtain workload, the framework delivers analytical, easy-to-analyze expressions for the corresponding stochastic power and temperature profiles without prior assumptions about their probability distributions. The computational time and accuracy of our approach are assessed by comparison with Monte Carlo simulations, which confirm the efficiency of the proposed technique.
