Multiprocessor system design based on deterministic techniques for power-temperature analysis is, in the context of current and future technologies, both unreliable and inefficient since the presence of uncertainty is disregarded. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic framework for quantification of power and temperature variations that handles diverse probability laws and dependency structures of the uncertain parameters. Given a nominal dynamic power profile, the framework delivers analytical, easy-to-analyze expressions for the resulting stochastic power and temperature traces without making prior assumptions about their probability distributions. The computational time and accuracy of our approach are assessed by Monte Carlo simulations, which confirms the efficiency of the proposed technique.
