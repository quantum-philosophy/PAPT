Multiprocessor system design based on deterministic techniques for power-temperature analysis is, in the context of current and future technologies, both unreliable and inefficient since the presence of uncertainty, primarily originating from process variation, is disregarded.
In this article, we propose a probabilistic framework for the quantification of power and temperature variations that handles diverse probability laws of the underlying uncertain parameters.
For a given system under a certain workload, the framework delivers analytical representations of the corresponding stochastic power and temperature profiles.
These representations allow for a computationally efficient estimation of the probability distributions and accompanying quantities, such as expectations, variances, and quantiles, of the power and temperature characteristics of the system.
The computational time and accuracy of our approach are assessed by a comparison with Monte Carlo simulations, which confirms the efficiency of the proposed technique.
