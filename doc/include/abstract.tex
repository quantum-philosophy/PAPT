Embedded system design based on deterministic techniques for power-temperature analysis (PTA) is, in the context of current and future technologies, both unreliable and inefficient since the presence of uncertainty is disregarded. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic PTA framework for exploring multiprocessor systems that depend on random parameters. Our technique addresses diverse probability distributions and joint effects of such parameters on the systems' power and temperature profiles. Specifically, given a nominal power trace, the framework constructs a light surrogate model for the corresponding stochastic power and temperature traces, which is easy for extraction of various statistics such as probabilistic moments, distribution functions, density functions, \etc\ The computational time and accuracy of our approach are assessed by Monte Carlo simulations, which confirm the efficiency of the proposed technique.
