Multiprocessor system design based on deterministic techniques for power-temperature analysis is, in the context of current and future technologies, both unreliable and inefficient since the presence of uncertainty, in particular, due to process variation, is disregarded.
In this paper, we propose a probabilistic framework for the characterization of power and temperature variations that handles diverse probability laws of the underlying uncertain parameters.
Given a multiprocessor system under a certain workload, the framework delivers analytical representations of the corresponding stochastic power and temperature profiles.
These representations allow for a computationally efficient estimation of the probability distributions and accompanying quantities, such as moments, probabilities, and quantiles, of the power and temperature characteristics of the system.
The approximation accuracy and computational time of our approach are assessed by a comparison with Monte Carlo simulations, which confirms the efficiency of the proposed technique.
