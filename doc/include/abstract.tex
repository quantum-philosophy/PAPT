A probabilistic framework for quantification of temperature and power variations of multiprocessor systems is presented. Given knowledge of probability distributions of the intrisict uncertain parameters, which affect the power dissipation of the processing elements within a multiprocessor platform, and a nominal dynamic power profile, the framework produces analytical expressions for the resulting temperature and power traces. The expressions are sums of orthogonal polynomials in random variables, which are essentially easy for subsequent analyses. The computational time and accuracy of our technique are assessed using a Monte Carlo sampling method, which confirms the superior performance of the proposed framework.
