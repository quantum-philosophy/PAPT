A probabilistic framework for quantification of temperature and power variations within stochastic multiprocessor systems is presented. The framework is based on (1) a high-level thermal specification of the platform, (2) probability laws and a correlation structure of the intrinsic uncertain parameters that affect the power dissipation of the processing elements, and (3) an arbitrary power model, in which the uncertain parameters are inputs. Given a nominal dynamic power profile, the framework delivers analytical expressions for the resulting stochastic temperature and power traces. The formulations are essentially easy from the perspective of a wide range of subsequent analyses. The computational time and accuracy of our technique are assessed by a Monte Carlo sampling method, which confirms the superior performance of the proposed framework.
