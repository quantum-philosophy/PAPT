At \stage{1}, $\vU$ should be preprocessed in order to extract a vector of mutually independent random variables denoted by $\vZ$.
Following the guidance given in \sref{uncertain-parameters}, the most suitable transformation for the ongoing scenario is the Nataf transformation.
Here we describe the algorithm in brief and refer the interested reader to \cite{li2008} for additional details.
The transformation is typically presented in two steps.
First, $\vU \in \real^\nparams$, $\nparams = \nprocs + 1$, is morphed into correlated Gaussian variables, denoted by $\vZ' \in \real^\nparams$, using the knowledge of the marginal distributions and covariance matrix of $\vU$.
Second, the obtained correlated Gaussian variables are mapped into independent standard Gaussian variables, denoted by $\vZ'' \in \real^\nparams$, using one of several available techniques; see \cite{li2008}.

The number of stochastic dimensions, which so far is $\nprocs + 1$, directly impacts the computational cost of PC expansions as it is discussed in \sref{computational-challenges}.
Therefore, one should consider a possibility for model order reduction before constructing PC expansions.
To this end, we perform the second step of the Nataf transformation by virtue of the discrete Karhunen-Lo\`{e}ve (KL) decomposition \cite{ghanem1991} as the reduction comes naturally in this way.
A description of this procedure can be found in \aref{karhunen-loeve}.
Let us denote the trimmed independent variables by $\vZ'''$ and their number by $\nvars$.
We also denote the whole operation, \ie, the reduction-aware Nataf transformation, by
\[
  \vU = \oInvNataf{\vZ'''}
\]
where the superscript ``$-1$'' signifies the fact that we are interested in expressing $\vU$ \via\ $\vZ'''$ and, hence, need to perform all the operations in the reversed order.

At this point, we have $\nvars$ independent Gaussian random variables $\vZ'''$, which already suffice the independence prerequisite of PC expansions (see \sref{uncertain-parameters}).
However, we would like to retain, after the Nataf transformation and model order reduction, the boundedness of the initial beta variables $\vU$ since the PC expansions constructed in terms of bounded variables will also be bounded, which more accurately reflect the underlying physics.
Therefore, we undertake one additional transformation on top that yields the desired bounded and independent parameters, which we denote by $\vZ: \outcomes \to \real^\nvars$ throughout the paper.
This transformation is a standard technique based on an application of the CDF of $\vZ$, denoted by $\fCDF_{\vZ}$, followed by an application of the inverse CDF of $\vZ'''$, denoted by $\fCDF_{\vZ'''}$.
The overall probability transformation $\oTransform$ (see \sref{uncertain-parameters}) from $\vU$ to $\vZ$ is then given as follows:
\[
  \vU = \oTransform{\vZ} = \oInvNataf{\fCDF^{-1}_{\vZ'''}(\fCDF_{\vZ}(\vZ))}.
\]
