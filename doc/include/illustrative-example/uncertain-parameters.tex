The power dissipation is composed of two major parts: dynamic and leakage. The influence of process variation on the dynamic power is known to be negligibly small \cite{juan2011, juan2012, srivastava2010}; on the other hand, the variability of leakage is substantial, wherein the subthreshold current contributes the most \cite{juan2011, juan2012}. Hence, we focus on the subthreshold leakage and, more specifically, on the effective channel length denoted by $\Leff$. The variations of $\Leff$ are split into global (inter-die) and local (intra-die) parts \cite{chandra2010, juan2011, juan2012, srivastava2010, shen2009}. The global contribution is shared among all the processing elements and, therefore, is modeled as a single \rv\ $\gLeff(\o)$; furthermore, $\gLeff(\o)$ is typically assumed to be intependent with respect to the local variations. The latter, however, are known to have spatial correlations, which, due to particularities of the manufacturing process, often bear radial structures \cite{friedberg2005, cheng2011}. Therefore, as in \cite{ghanta2006}, we model the intra-die variations as a space-continuous stochastic process $\lLeff(r, \o)$ with the following radial covariance function \cite{ghanem1991}:
\begin{equation} \elabel{covariance-function}
  \oCov{\lLeff(r_i, \o), \lLeff(r_j, \o)} = e^{-|r_i - r_j|/\corrLength}
\end{equation}
where $r_i$ is the distance between the $i$th processing element and the center of the die, and $\corrLength$ is the correlation length. In words, the structure implies that the smaller the radial distance between two processing elements on the die, the more likely they are to have similar deviations of the effective channel length. Finally, it is generally accepted that the variations of the channel length have Gaussian distributions \cite{juan2011, juan2012, srivastava2010}. Therefore, we assume that the \rv\ $\gLeff(\o)$ as well as the process $\lLeff(r, \o)$ are Gaussian.

% \eref{covariance-function} together with the floorplan of the die---recall the thermal specification $\system$ defined in \sref{problem-formulation}---are used to compute the correlation matrix of $\vU(\o)$. For convenience, the matrix is extended by one dimension to pack $\gLeff(\o)$ and $\lLeff_i(\o)$ together, \ie, it obtains one zero column and one zero raw with the only non-zero element equal to one on the diagonal. Finally, taking into account the variances of all the \rvs, the covariance matrix of $\vU(\o)$ is formed and is denoted by $\mCov_\vU$.
%
% Therefore, the channel length within the $i$th processing element is given as
% \[
%   \Leff_i(\o) = \nLeff + \gLeff(\o) + \lLeff_i(\o)
% \]
% where $\nLeff$ is the nominal channel length, $\gLeff(\o)$ is a zero-mean \rv\ for the global component, and $\lLeff_i(\o)$ is a zero-mean \rv\ for the local component of variability. Consequently, there are $\cores + 1$ uncertain parameters that form the random vector
% \[
%   \vU(\o) = \vec{\lLeff_1(\o), \dots, \lLeff_\cores(\o), \gLeff(\o)}.
% \]

$\gLeff(\o)$ and $\lLeff(r, \o)$ form the input set of uncertain parameters $\vU(r, \o)$, which is to be processed in order to extract a finite set of mutually independent \rvs\ $\vZ(\o)$. Following the guidelines in \sref{uncertain-parameters}, Stage~1 of our framework, the KL expansion suits the best in such a situation. Unfortunately, a thorough elaboration on KL is out of the scope of this paper; however, the interested reader is referred to \aref{uncertain-parameters} in the appendix where an application of KL to \eref{covariance-function} is shown.
