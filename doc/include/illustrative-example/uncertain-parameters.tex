At \stage{1}, $\vU(\o)$ should be preprocessed in order to extract a set of mutually independent random variables, $\vZ(\o)$.
Following the guidance given in \sref{uncertain-parameters}, the most suitable transformation for the ongoing scenario is the Nataf transformation.
Here, we describe the algorithm in brief and refer the interested reader to \cite{li2008} for additional details. The transformation is typically presented in two steps.
First, $\vU(\o) \in \real^{\nprocs + 1}$ are morphed into correlated Gaussian variables, denoted by $\vZ'(\o) \in \real^{\nprocs + 1}$, using the knowledge of the covariance matrix and marginal distributions of $\vU(\o)$.
Second, the obtained correlated Gaussian variables are mapped into independent standard Gaussian variables, denoted by $\vZ''(\o) \in \real^{\nprocs + 1}$, using one of several available techniques such as the Cholesky decomposition \cite{press2007} utilized in \cite{li2008}.

The number of stochastic dimensions, which so far is $\nprocs + 1$, directly impacts the computational cost of PC expansions as it is discussed in \aref{polynomial-chaos}.
Therefore, one should consider a possibility of model order reduction before constructing PC expansions.
To this end, we perform the second step of the Nataf transformation by virtue of the discrete Karhunen-Lo\`{e}ve (KL) decomposition \cite{ghanem1991} as the reduction comes naturally in this way.
A description of this procedure can be found in \aref{karhunen-loeve}.
Let us denote the shrunk independent variables by $\vZ'''(\o)$ and their number by $\nvars$.
We also denote the whole operation, \ie, the reduction-aware Nataf transformation by $\vU(\o) = \oInvNataf{\vZ'''(\o)}$, $\vZ'''(\o) \in \real^\nvars$ where the superscript signifies the fact that we are interested in expressing $\vU(\o)$ through $\vZ'''(\o)$ and, therefore, we need to perform all the operations in the reversed order.

At this point, we have $\nvars$ independent Gaussian variables $\vZ'''(\o)$; however, we wish to work with independent beta-distributed variables instead, which will be our final independent parameters denoted by $\vZ(\o)$.
Therefore, we undertake one additional transformation on top.
This transformation is a standard technique \cite{durrett2010} based on an application of the CDF of $\vZ(\o)$, denoted by $\CDF_{\vZ}$, followed by an application of the inverse CDF of $\vZ'''(\o)$, denoted by $\CDF_{\vZ'''}$.
The overall probability transformation $\oTransform$ (see \sref{uncertain-parameters}) from $\vU(\o)$ to $\vZ(\o)$ is then
\[
  \vU(\o) = \oTransform{\vZ(\o)} = \oInvNataf{\CDF^{-1}_{\vZ'''}(\CDF_{\vZ}(\vZ(\o)))}.
\]
