At \stage{1}, $\vU$ should be preprocessed in order to extract a vector of mutually independent random variables denoted by $\vZ$.
Following the guidance given in \sref{uncertain-parameters}, the most suitable transformation for the ongoing scenario is the Nataf transformation.
Here we describe the algorithm in brief and refer the interested reader to \cite{li2008} for additional details.
The transformation is typically presented in two steps.
First, $\vU \in \real^\nparams$, $\nparams = \nprocs + 1$, is morphed into correlated Gaussian variables, denoted by $\vZ' \in \real^\nparams$, using the knowledge of the marginal distributions and covariance matrix of $\vU$.
Second, the obtained correlated Gaussian variables are mapped into independent standard Gaussian variables, denoted by $\vZ'' \in \real^\nparams$, using one of several available techniques; see \cite{li2008}.

The number of stochastic dimensions, which so far is $\nprocs + 1$, directly impacts the computational cost of PC expansions as it is discussed in \sref{computational-challenges}.
Therefore, one should consider a possibility for model order reduction before constructing PC expansions.
To this end, we perform the second step of the Nataf transformation by virtue of the discrete Karhunen-Lo\`{e}ve (KL) decomposition \cite{ghanem1991} as the reduction comes naturally in this way.
A description of this procedure can be found in \aref{karhunen-loeve}.
Let us denote the trimmed independent variables by $\vZ'''$ and their number by $\nvars$.
We also denote the whole operation, \ie, the reduction-aware Nataf transformation, by
\[
  \vU = \oInvNataf{\vZ'''}
\]
where the superscript ``$-1$'' signifies the fact that we are interested in expressing $\vU$ \via\ $\vZ'''$ and, hence, need to perform all the operations in the reversed order.

At this point, we have $\nvars$ independent Gaussian random variables stored in $\vZ'''$, which already suffice the independence prerequisite for PC expansions (see \sref{uncertain-parameters}).
However, we prefer to construct PC expansions in terms of bounded variables since such expansions will also be bounded.
To this end, we undertake one additional transformation that yields a vector of (independent) random variables $\vZ \in \real^\nvars$ whose distributions have bounded supports.
This transformation is a standard technique based on the composition of the inverse \cdf\ of $\vZ'''$ and the \cdf\ of $\vZ$ denoted by $\fCDF^{-1}_{\vZ'''}$ and $\fCDF_{\vZ}$, respectively.
The overall probability transformation $\oTransform$ (see \sref{uncertain-parameters}) from $\vU$ to $\vZ$ is then given as follows:
\[
  \vU = \oTransform{\vZ} = \oInvNataf{\fCDF^{-1}_{\vZ'''}(\fCDF_{\vZ}(\vZ))}.
\]
The distributions of $\vZ$ can be chosen arbitrary as long as one can construct a suitable polynomial basis as described in \sref{pc-basis}.
We let $\vZ$ have beta distributions, staying in the same family of distributions with the parameters $\vU$.
