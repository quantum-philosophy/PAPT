At \stage{1}, $\vU(\o)$ should be preprocessed in order to extract a set of mutually independent random variables, $\vZ(\o)$.
Following the guidance given in \sref{uncertain-parameters}, the most suitable transformation for the ongoing scenario is the Nataf transformation.
Here we describe the algorithm in brief and refer the interested reader to \cite{li2008} for additional details. The transformation is typically presented in two steps.
First, $\vU(\o) \in \real^{\nprocs + 1}$ are morphed into correlated Gaussian variables, denoted by $\vZ'(\o) \in \real^{\nprocs + 1}$, using the knowledge of the covariance matrix and marginal distributions of $\vU(\o)$.
Second, the obtained correlated Gaussian variables are mapped into independent standard Gaussian variables, denoted by $\vZ''(\o) \in \real^{\nprocs + 1}$, using one of several available techniques such as the Cholesky decomposition \cite{press2007} utilized in \cite{li2008}.

The number of stochastic dimensions, which so far is $\nprocs + 1$, directly impacts the computational cost of PC expansions as it is discussed in \sref{computational-challenges}.
Therefore, one should consider a possibility of model order reduction before constructing PC expansions.
To this end, we perform the second step of the Nataf transformation by virtue of the discrete Karhunen-Lo\`{e}ve (KL) decomposition \cite{ghanem1991} as the reduction comes naturally in this way.
A description of this procedure can be found in \aref{karhunen-loeve}.
Let us denote the shrunk independent variables by $\vZ'''(\o)$ and their number by $\nvars$.
We also denote the whole operation, \ie, the reduction-aware Nataf transformation, by
\[
  \vU(\o) = \oInvNataf{\vZ'''(\o)}
\]
where the superscript ``$-1$'' signifies the fact that we are interested in expressing $\vU(\o)$ \via\ $\vZ'''(\o)$ and, hence, we need to perform all the operations in the reversed order.

At this point, we have $\nvars$ independent Gaussian random variables $\vZ'''(\o)$, which already suffice the independence prerequisite of PC expansions (see \sref{uncertain-parameters}).
However, as motivated earlier, we prefer to work with independent beta-distributed random variables instead since the PC expansions constructed in terms of such variables will have bounded supports, which more accurately reflect the underlying physics.
Therefore, we undertake one additional transformation on top, resulting in our final independent parameters denoted by $\vZ(\o)$ throughout the paper.
This transformation is a standard technique \cite{durrett2010} based on an application of the CDF of $\vZ(\o)$, denoted by $\fCDF_{\vZ}$, followed by an application of the inverse CDF of $\vZ'''(\o)$, denoted by $\fCDF_{\vZ'''}$.
The overall probability transformation $\oTransform$ (see \sref{uncertain-parameters}) from $\vU(\o)$ to $\vZ(\o)$ is
\[
  \vU(\o) = \oTransform{\vZ(\o)} = \oInvNataf{\fCDF^{-1}_{\vZ'''}(\fCDF_{\vZ}(\vZ(\o)))}.
\]
