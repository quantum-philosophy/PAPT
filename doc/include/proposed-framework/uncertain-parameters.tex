Independence of the uncertain parameters is a prerequisite of PC.
In general, however, $\vU(\o)$ can be correlated and, therefore, should be preprocessed in order to fulfill the requirement.
To this end, an adequate probability transformation should be undertaken \cite{eldred2009}.
Denote such a transformation by $\vU(\o) = \oTransform{\vZ(\o)}$, which relates the correlated uncertain parameters $\vU(\o)$ with $\nvars$ independent random variables $\vZ(\o)$.
Without loss of generality, $\vZ(\o)$ are assumed to be centered and normalized, \ie, $\oExp{\vZ(\o)} = \mZero$ and $\oCov{\vZ(\o)} = \mI$.

Correlated random variables that form a Gaussian vector can be transformed into independent ones via a linear mapping based on a factorization procedure of the covariance matrix or covariance function of $\vU(\o)$; the procedure is known as the Karhunen-Lo\`{e}ve decomposition.
In the general case, the most prominent solutions are the Rosenblatt \cite{rosenblatt1952} and Nataf transformations \cite{li2008}.
Rosenblatt's approach is suitable when the joint probability distribution function of the uncertain parameters $\vU(\o)$ is given; however, such information is rarely available.
The marginal probability distributions and correlation matrix of $\vU(\o)$ are more likely to be given, which are sufficient to perform the Nataf transformation.
The Nataf method is composed of two steps: first, $\vU(\o)$ are morphed into correlated Gaussian variables, then the correlations of the obtained Gaussian variables are removed using the KL decomposition.
We shall illustrate this technique in \sref{ie-uncertain-parameters}.
