Independence of the parameters is a prerequisite of the PC approach.
In general, however, $\vU(\o)$ can be correlated and, therefore, should be preprocessed in order to fulfill the requirement.
To this end, an adequate probability transformation should be undertaken \cite{eldred2008}.
Denote such a transformation by $\vU(\o) = \oTransform{\vZ(\o)}$, which relates the correlated uncertain parameters $\vU(\o)$ with $\nvars$ independent random variables $\vZ(\o)$.

Correlated random variables can be transformed into uncorrelated ones \via\ a linear mapping based on a factorization procedure of the covariance matrix or covariance function of $\vU(\o)$; the procedure is known as the Karhunen-Lo\`{e}ve (KL) decomposition \cite{ghanem1991}.
In addition, if the correlated variables form a Gaussian vector then the uncorrelated ones are also mutually independent.
In the general case (non-Gaussian), the most prominent solutions are the Rosenblatt \cite{rosenblatt1952} and Nataf transformations \cite{li2008}.
Rosenblatt's approach is suitable when the joint probability distribution function of the uncertain parameters $\vU(\o)$ is given; however, such information is rarely available.
The marginal probability distributions and correlation matrix of $\vU(\o)$ are more likely to be given, which are sufficient to perform the Nataf transformation that delivers correlated Gaussian variables followed by the KL decomposition in order to acquire the desired independence.

Apart from the extraction of independent parameters, one typically would like to undertake a model order reduction procedure at this stage as well since the number of stochastic dimensions of the problem directly impacts the complexity of the rest of the computations.
The intuition is that, due to the correlations between the entries of $\vU(\o)$, some of them can be harmlessly replaced by combinations of the rest. This operation is often treaded as a part of the KL decomposition.

In \sref{ie-uncertain-parameters}, we shall demonstrate the use of the Nataf transformation together with the KL decomposition.
