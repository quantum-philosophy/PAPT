The goal is to transform the ``problematic'' term in \eref{recurrence}, \ie, the power term defined by \eref{power-model}, in such a way that the recurrence in \eref{recurrence} becomes computationally tractable. Our solution is the construction of a surrogate model for the power model in \eref{power-model}, which we further propagate through \eref{recurrence} to obtain an approximation for temperature. To this end, we employ the generalized polynomial chaos (PC) \cite{xiu2002}, which decomposes stochastic quantities into infinite series of orthogonal polynomials of \rvs. Such a series is especially attractive from the post-processing perspective as it is nothing more than a polynomial, the concept that everybody is familiar with; hence, a PC expansion is easy to interpret and is essentially easy to evaluate. An introduction to orthogonal polynomials can be found in the appendix, \aref{orthogonal-polynomials}.

The first step towards a PC expansion is the choice of a suitable polynomial basis $\{ \pcb_i(\vz) \}$, which is typically picked from the Askey scheme of orthogonal polynomials \cite{xiu2002}. As an example, the Hermite polynomial basis is depicted in \fref{hermite}. The step is crucial as the rate of convergence of PC expansions closely depends on it. There are no strict rules that guarantee the optimal choice \cite{maitre2010, knio2006}; however, there are best practices which say that one should be guided by the probability distributions of the \rvs\ that drive the stochastic system. The reason for this is that each polynomial basis is orthogonal with respect to a certain weight function (see \aref{orthogonal-polynomials}), and some of such weight functions directly correspond to certain \pdfs; therefore, when these two functions match each other, it can have a positive effect on convergence \cite{xiu2002}. \tref{askey} in the appendix displays several examples of such paired probability distributions and polynomial bases. For instance, when the \rvs\ $\vZ(\o)$ follow a beta distribution, the Jacobi basis is worth being tried first. On the other hand, the basis in \fref{hermite} is preferable for Gaussian \rvs.

Having an appropriate basis chosen, we apply the PC procedure to power in \eref{recurrence} and truncate the resulting infinite series in order to make it feasible for practical implementations. Such an expansion is formally defined as
\begin{equation} \elabel{pc-expansion}
  \oPC{\vars}{\pcorder}{\vP_k(\o)} = \sum_{i = 1}^{\pcterms} \pcc{\vP}_{ki} \; \pcb_i(\vZ(\o))
\end{equation}
where $\{ \pcb_i(\vZ(\o)) \}_{i = 1}^{\pcterms}$ is the truncated basis with $\pcterms$ polynomial terms of $\vars$ variables, and $\pcc{\vP}_{ki} \in \real^\cores$ are the coefficients of the expansion. The latter are computed using spectral projections as it is explained in the appendix, \aref{spectral-projection}. $\pcorder$ denotes the order of the expansion, which determines the maximal degree of the $\vars$-variate polynomials involved in the expansion; hence, $\pcorder$ also defines accuracy.

It can be seen in \eref{recurrence} that, due to the linearity of the operations involved in the recurrence, $\vX_k(\o)$ retains the same polynomial structure as $\vP_k(\o)$. Therefore, using \eref{pc-expansion}, \eref{recurrence} is rewritten as follows, for $k = 1, \dotsc, \steps$:
\begin{equation} \elabel{expanded-recurrence}
  \oPC{\vars}{\pcorder}{\vX_k(\o)} = \mCF_k \: \oPC{\vars}{\pcorder}{\vX_{k-1}(\o)} + \mCS_k \: \oPC{\vars}{\pcorder}{\vP_k(\o)}.
\end{equation}
Thus, there are two PC expansions for two concurrent stochastic processes with the same basis but different coefficients. As shown in \aref{spectral-projection}, \eref{expanded-recurrence} can be reduced to
\begin{equation} \elabel{pc-recurrence}
  \pcc{\vX}_{ki} = \mCF_k \: \pcc{\vX}_{(k - 1)i} + \mCS_k \: \pcc{\vP}_{ki}
\end{equation}
where $k = 1, \dotsc, \steps$ and $i = 1, \dotsc, \pcterms$. Finally, \eref{fourier-output} and \eref{pc-recurrence} are combined together to compute the coefficients of the PC expansion of the temperature vector $\vTO_k(\o)$.

To summarize, let us recall the stochastic recurrence in \eref{recurrence} where, in the presence of correlations, an arbitrary functional $\vP_k(\omega)$ of the uncertain parameters $\vU(\o)$ and random temperature $\vTO_k(\o)$ (see \sref{power-model}) needs to be evaluated and combined with another random vector, $\vX_k(\omega)$. Now, the recurrence in \eref{recurrence} has been replaced with a purely deterministic recurrence in \eref{pc-recurrence} that involves only linear operations. Moreover, looking further into the past, the performed spectral decompositions have substituted the heavy thermal system in \eref{fourier-system} with a light polynomial surrogate defined by a set of basis functions $\{ \pcb_i(\vz) \}$ and the corresponding sets of coefficients, namely, $\{ \pcc{\vP}_{ki} \}$ for power and $\{ \pcc{\vTO}_{ki} \}$ for temperature, where $k$ traverses all the $\steps$ intervals $\dt_k$ of the considered time span. Consequently, the output of the proposed framework constitutes two stochastic profiles, the power $\profP{\o}$ and temperature $\profT{\o}$ profiles, that are ready to be analyzed from the UQ perspective.
