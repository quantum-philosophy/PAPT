\updated{Given the thermal specification $\system$ of the system at hand (see the second paragraph of \sref{problem-formulation}), an equivalent thermal RC circuit with $\nnodes$ thermal nodes is constructed \cite{skadron2004}.}
The structure of the circuit depends on the intended level of granularity and, therefore, impacts the resulting accuracy.
\updated{Without loss of generality, we assume that each processing element is mapped onto one corresponding node, and the thermal package is represented as a set of additional nodes.}

The thermal behavior of the constructed circuit is modeled with the following system of differential-algebraic equations (see \aref{thermal-model} for a derivation):
\begin{subnumcases}{\elabel{fourier-system}}
  \frac{d\vX(\t, \o)}{d\t} = \mA \: \vX(\t, \o) + \mB \: \vP(\t, \o) \elabel{fourier-de} \\
  \vTO(\t, \o) = \mB^T \vX(\t, \o) + \vTO_\amb \elabel{fourier-output}
\end{subnumcases}
where $\vP(\t, \o)$ and $\vTO(\t, \o)$ are the input power and output temperature vectors of the processing elements, respectively, and $\vX \in \real^\nnodes$ is the vector of the internal state of the system.
\updated{Note that, as shown in \eref{power-model}, $\vP(\t, \o)$ is an arbitrary function of $\vTO(\t, \o)$.
Therefore, in general, the system in \eref{fourier-de} is nonlinear and does not have a closed-form solution.}

Recall that the power and temperature profiles we work with are discrete-time representations of the power consumption and heat dissipation, respectively, which contain $\nsteps$ samples, or steps, covering a certain time span (see \sref{problem-formulation}).
As detailed in \aref{thermal-model}, we let the total power be constant between neighboring power steps and reduce the solution process of \eref{fourier-system} to the following recurrence, for $k = 1, \dotsc, \nsteps$,
\begin{equation} \elabel{recurrence}
  \vX_k(\o) = \mCF_k \: \vX_{k - 1}(\o) + \mCS_k \: \vP_k(\o)
\end{equation}
where $\vX_0(\o) = \vZero$.
In the deterministic case, \eref{recurrence} can be readily employed to perform deterministic transient PTA \cite{thiele2011, ukhov2012}.
In the stochastic case, however, the analysis of \eref{recurrence} is substantially different since $\vP_k(\o)$ and, consequently, $\vX_k(\o)$ and $\vTO_k(\o)$ are probabilistic quantities.
The situation is complicated by the fact that, at each step of the iterative process in \eref{recurrence}, (a) $\vP_k(\o)$ is an arbitrary transformation of the uncertain parameters $\vU(\o)$ and stochastic temperature $\vTO_k(\o)$ (see \sref{power-model}), which results in a multivariate random variable with a generally unknown probability distribution, and (b) $\vU(\o)$, $\vP_k(\o)$, $\vX_k(\o)$, and $\vTO_k(\o)$ are dependent random variables as the latter three are functions of $\vU(\o)$.
Therefore, the operations involved in the recurrence given by \eref{recurrence} are to be performed on dependent random variables with arbitrary probability distributions, which, in general, have no closed-form solutions.
To tackle this difficulty, we utilize PC expansions as we shall discuss in the next section.
