Dear Reviewers,
\\
\\
\\
\noindent Thank you for your time and valuable feedback.
Please find below our response to your comments.
In order to eliminate any confusion due to the changes in the list of references, in our answers, we shall use the ``[Authors, Year]'' format of citations instead of ``[Number].''
The text of the comments is placed in \reviewerBox{boxes} with dark gray borders and pale blue backgrounds.
Each such box is followed by our reply and a short summary of the taken actions given as a \done{checklist} highlighted with a blue color and underlined.
In the manuscript, the new and updated parts are \updated{marked} with a red color and underlined.
The changed figures are placed in \figureBox{boxes} with red borders and pale red backgrounds.
Due to the limitation of space, three figures have been removed from the paper, namely, Fig.~4, depicting the first six polynomials of the Hermite basis, Fig.~5, illustrating a beta fit to the standard Gaussian distribution, and Fig.~10, comparing full-tensor product and sparse integration grids.
\\

\noindent Sincerely yours,\\
Ivan Ukhov, Prof. Petru Eles, and Prof. Zebo Peng
