Dear Reviewers,
\\
\\
\\
\noindent Thank you for your time and valuable feedback.
Please find below our response to your comments.
In order to eliminate any confusion due to the changes in the list of references, in our answers, we shall use the ``[Surname, Year]'' format of citations instead of ``[Number].''
The text of the comments is placed in \reviewerBox{boxes} with dark gray borders and pale blue backgrounds.
Each such box is followed by our reply and a short summary of the taken actions given as a \done{checklist} highlighted with a blue color and underlined.
In the manuscript, the new and updated parts are \updated{marked} with a red color and underlined.
The changed figures are placed in \figureBox{boxes} with red borders and pale red backgrounds.
Due to the limitation of space and in order to properly address the received comments, the following items have been removed:
(a) Tab.~1 matching probability distributions with polynomial bases;
(b) Fig.~2 showing normal probability plots;
(c) Fig.~4 depicting the first six Hermite polynomials;
(d) Fig.~6 illustrating an equivalent thermal RC circuit; and
(e) Fig.~10 comparing full-tensor-product and sparse integration grids.
However, we do believe that these changes are for the best: the volume remains unchanged, but the clarity of the paper has been considerably increased.
\\

Ivan Ukhov, Prof. Petru Eles, and Prof. Zebo Peng
