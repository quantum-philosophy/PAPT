In a nutshell, the goal stated in \sref{problem-formulation} is achieved as follows. First, we begin with the commonly found formalism of constructing a thermal model given a thermal specification $\system$. Due to the complexity of the underlying physical phenomenon---that is, the heat trasfer within a multiprocessor system---such a model is inherently expensive from the computational perspective, which makes the straightforward MC-based analysis prohibited and often infiasible. Instead, we construct a surrogate model, or a meta model, which is light, \ie, the effords needed to obtain power and temperature traces given an assignment of the uncertain parameters are negligibly small compared to the initial problem formulation. This light model can now undergo the same MC sampling as one might think of at the very beginning, but this time the procedure is performed in a much more efficient manner; therefore, such quantities as CDFs and PDFs/PMFs can be trivially estimated. Moreover, the constructed surrogate provides analytical formulae for the moments, \ie, the expected value, variance, \etc\ are readily available without any sampling.

The the major steps of our technique are depicted in \fref{algorithm} and are spelled out below.

\step{1}{Uncertain Parameters Processing (\sref{uncertain-parameters}).} Since the employed mathematical framework operates on \emph{independent} RVs, the input set of uncertain parameters $\vU(\o)$ is preprocessed in order to satisfy this requirement.

\step{2}{Power Model Construction (\sref{power-model}).} A power model, which captures the effect of the uncertain parameters and of the temperature on the power dissipation of the processing elements, is chosen at this stage.

\step{3}{Thermal Model Construction (\sref{thermal-model}).} With respect to the thermal specification $\system$ defined in \sref{problem-formulation}, an equivalent thermal representation of the system is constructed, in which the processing elements and thermal package are mapped onto a set of so-called thermal nodes.

\step{4}{Polynomial Chaos (PC) Expansion (\sref{polynomial-chaos}).} For each time interval of the input dynamic power profile $\profPdyn$, the corresponding polynomial expansions of the stochastic power dissipation and temperature are calculated.

\step{5}{Output Processing (\sref{output-processing}).} The computed PC expansions are analyzed in order to obtain the desired characteristics of the system, \eg, moments, probability density functions (PDFs), cumulative distribution functions (CDFs).
