In a nutshell, the goal stated in \sref{problem-formulation} is achieved as follows. We begin with the commonly found formalism of constructing a thermal model given a thermal specification $\system$. Due to the complexity of the underlying physical phenomenon---that is, heat trasfer within a multiprocessor system---such a model is expensive from the computational perspective; this fact makes the straightforward UQ based on MC simulations prohibited and often infiasible. Instead of working directly with the obtained model, we construct a surrogate model, or a meta model, using the theory of polynomial chaos (PC) expansions. Such a representation is essentially light, \ie, the effords needed to obtain power and temperature traces, given an assignment of the uncertain parameters, are negligible compared to those needed for the initial problem formulation. Now, the surrogate model can undergo the same sampling that one might adopt from the very beginning, but this time the procedure is undertaken in a much more efficient manner. Therefore, such quantities as \cdfs\ and \pdfs\ can be trivially estimated. Moreover, the representations, which we compute, provide analytical formulae for probabilistic moments, \ie, the expected value, variance, \etc\ are readily available without any sampling.

The major steps of our technique are depicted in \fref{algorithm} and are ourlined below whereas detailed discussions are given in the following five subsections, \sref{uncertain-parameters}--\sref{output-processing}.

\step{1}{Uncertain Parameters (\sref{uncertain-parameters}).} PC, employed in this paper to perform UQ, operate on a finite set of independent \rvs. The uncertain parameters $\vU(\o)$ might not satisfy this requirement and, therefore, should be preprocessed first; the corresponding finite, independent set is denoted by $\vZ(\o)$.

\step{2}{Power Model (\sref{power-model}).} A model of the power dissipation is to be defined at this stage: the user determines the effect that the uncertain parameters $\vU(\o)$ have on the total power consumption $\vP(\t, \o)$ of the system given the nominal dynamic power $\vP_\dyn(\t)$, temperature $\vTO(\t, \o)$, and uncertain parameters $\vU(\o)$, for some fixed $\t$ and $\o$ (explained in \sref{uncertain-parameters}).

\step{3}{Thermal Model (\sref{thermal-model}).} With respect to the thermal specification $\system$ (see \sref{problem-formulation}), a mathematical model of the thermal system is constructed. The thermal model closely interacts with the power model from Stage~2 and produces the corresponding power and temperature profiles for a given nominal dynamic power profile and an assignment of $\vU(\o)$. As at Stage~2, the model produced at Stage~3 acts deterministically. Note that, in the context of the MC sampling, these computations would be performed thousands of times with different outcomes $\{ \vU_i \}_{i = 1}^{\mcsamples}$ of $\vU(\o)$, for some large $\mcsamples$, which, as motivated earlier, is prohibited in practice.

\step{4}{Surrogate Model (\sref{polynomial-chaos}).} The major part, wherein the surrogate model is atteined by traversing the given nominal power profile and gradually constructing polynomial expansions, in terms of the processed uncertain parameters $\vZ(\o)$ from Stage~1, for the stochastic power and temperature profiles. The output is essentially a substitute to the problem defined at Stage~3 with respect to the power model determined at Stage~2.

\step{5}{Post-processing (\sref{output-processing}).} The computed PC expansions are analyzed in order to obtain the desired characteristics of the system, \eg, \cdfs, \pdfs, moments.
