The main idea of our framework is to construct a surrogate model for the joint power and thermal models of the multiprocessor system using the theory of polynomial chaos (PC) expansions.
Having constructed this surrogate model, such quantities as cumulative distributions functions (\cdfs) and probability density functions (\pdfs) can be easily estimated. Moreover, the representations, which we compute, provide analytical formulae for probabilistic moments, \ie, the expected value, variance, \etc\ are readily available.

The major stages of our technique are depicted in \fref{algorithm}.

\stage{1}{Uncertain Parameters (\sref{uncertain-parameters}).}
The PC approach operates on mutually independent random variables. The uncertain parameters $\vU(\o)$ might not satisfy this requirement and, thus, should be preprocessed; we denote the corresponding independent random variables by $\vZ(\o)$.

\stage{2}{Power Model (\sref{power-model}).}
The user specifies the power model of the system \via\ a ``black-box'' functional $\oPower$, which computes the total power $\vP(\t, \o)$ for a particular temperature $\vTO(\t, \o)$ and an outcome of the parameters $\vU(\o)$.

\stage{3}{Thermal Model (\sref{thermal-model}).}
With respect to the thermal specification $\system$ (defined in \sref{problem-formulation}), a mathematical formulation of the thermal system is attained.
The thermal model closely interacts with the power model from \stage{2}\ and produces the corresponding temperature profile.

\stage{4}{Surrogate Model (\sref{polynomial-chaos}).}
The surrogate model is obtained by traversing the desired time span and gradually constructing polynomial expansions (in terms of the processed uncertain parameters $\vZ(\o)$ from \stage{1}) for the stochastic power and temperature profiles.
The output is essentially a substitute for the model produced at \stage{3}\ with respect to the power model determined at \stage{2}.

\stage{5}{Post-processing (\sref{post-processing}).}
The computed PC expansions are analyzed in order to obtain the needed characteristics of the system, \eg, \cdfs, \pdfs, and moments.

In the forthcoming subsections, \sref{uncertain-parameters}--\sref{post-processing}, the proposed framework is presented.
We shall pursue generality such that the user can easily adjust the technique to a particular application, characterized by specific uncertain parameters.
