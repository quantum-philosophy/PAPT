In this section, we present the proposed framework and begin with a brief overview of the major steps of our technique depicted in \fref{algorithm} and discussed below.

\step{1}{Uncertain Parameters Processing (\sref{uncertain-parameters}).} Since the employed mathematical framework operates on independent RVs, the input set of uncertain parameters $\vU(\o)$ is preprocessed in order to satisfy the requirement.

\step{2}{Power Model Construction (\sref{power-model}).} A power model that captures the effect of the uncertain parameters and temperature on the power dissipation of the processing elements within the system is chosen at this stage.

\step{3}{Thermal Model Construction (\sref{thermal-model}).} With respect to the thermal specification $\system$ defined in \sref{problem-formulation}, an equivalent thermal representation of the system is constructed, in which the processing elements and thermal package are mapped onto a set of so-called thermal nodes.

\step{4}{Polynomial Chaos (PC) Expansion (\sref{polynomial-chaos}).} For each time interval of the input dynamic power profile $\profPdyn$, the corresponding polynomial expansions of the stochastic power dissipation and temperature are calculated.

\step{5}{Output Processing (\sref{output-processing}).} The computed PC expansions are analyzed in order to obtain the desired characteristics of the system (moments, probability density functions, cumulative distribution functions, etc.).
