\subsection{Multi-Dimensional Integration}
The family of Gaussian quadrature rules is superior when it comes to the one-dimensional integration of smooth functions, viz. those that are well-approximated by a polynomial \cite{press2007}. In this case, the integral of interest is replaced by a weighted sum over $n$ points, which necessary gives the \emph{exact} solution when the integrand is a $(2n - 1)$-degree (or less) polynomial. The rules differ by the choice of abscissae and weights for the summation. For instance, the abscissae of the Gauss-Hermite quadrature rule are the roots of the Hermite polynomials, and the weight function is $e^{-x^2}$, which makes the rule suitable for the integration with respect to the Gaussian measure.

In the multi-dimensional case, which we have in \eref{pc-coefficients}, one usually employs so-called cubature rules that are constructed from one-dimensional quadrature rules. The rules are characterized by the level of accuracy $\cblevel \in \natural{1}$. A $\cblevel$-level cubature rule for the $\vars$-dimensional integration is defined as
\[
  \oCub{\vars}{\cblevel}{f} \eqdef \sum_{i = 1}^{\cbpoints} f(\cbp{\vU}_i) w_i
\]
where $\cbpoints$ is the number of summation points, $\cbp{\vU}_i \in \real^\vars$ and $w_i \in \real$ are the prescribed abscissae and weights, respectively. The abscissae are $\vars$-dimensional vectors, which corresponds the number of uncertain parameters $\vU(\o)$.

In order to tackle dependent r.v.'s for a non-Gaussian distribution, the approach proposed in \cite{babuska2010} can be applied.
