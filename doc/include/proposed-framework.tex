The basic idea of our framework is to construct a surrogate model using the theory of polynomial chaos (PC) expansions. Given this surrogate model, such quantities as cumulative distributions functions (\cdfs) and \pdfs\ can be trivially estimated. Moreover, the representations, which we compute, provide analytical formulae for probabilistic moments, \ie, the expected value, variance, \etc\ are readily available.

The major steps of our technique are depicted in \fref{algorithm} and are outlined below whereas detailed discussions are given in the following five subsections, \sref{uncertain-parameters}--\sref{output-processing}.

\step{1}{Uncertain Parameters (\sref{uncertain-parameters}).} The PC expansions, employed in this paper to perform UQ, operate on a finite set of independent \rvs. The uncertain parameters $\vU(\o)$ might not satisfy this requirement and, therefore, should be preprocessed; the corresponding finite, independent set of \rvs\ is denoted by $\vZ(\o)$.

\step{2}{Power Model (\sref{power-model}).} A model of the power dissipation is defined at this stage: the user determines the effect that the uncertain parameters have on the total consumption of power $\vP(\t, \o)$ given the nominal dynamic power $\vP_\dyn(\t)$, temperature $\vTO(\t, \o)$, and uncertain parameters $\vU(\o)$, for some fixed $\t$ and $\o$ (explained in \sref{uncertain-parameters}).

\step{3}{Thermal Model (\sref{thermal-model}).} With respect to the thermal specification $\system$ (see \sref{problem-formulation}), a mathematical model of the thermal system is constructed. The thermal model closely interacts with the power model from Stage~2 and produces the corresponding power and temperature profiles for a given nominal dynamic power profile and an outcome of $\vU(\o)$.

\step{4}{Surrogate Model (\sref{polynomial-chaos}).} The surrogate model is attained by traversing the given nominal power profile and gradually constructing polynomial expansions, in terms of the processed uncertain parameters $\vZ(\o)$ from Stage~1, for the stochastic power and temperature profiles. The output is essentially a substitute to the model produced at Stage~3 with respect to the power model determined at Stage~2.

\step{5}{Post-processing (\sref{output-processing}).} The computed PC expansions are analyzed in order to obtain the desired characteristics of the system, \eg, \cdfs, \pdfs, moments.
