In this section, we report the results of the proposed framework for different configurations of the illustrative example in \sref{illustrative-example}.
All the experiments are conducted on a GNU/Linux machine with Intel Core i7 2.66~GHz and 8~GB of RAM.

Now we shall elaborate on the default configuration of our experimental setup, which, in the following subsections, will be adjusted according to the purpose of each particular experiment.
We consider a 45-nanometer technological process.
The effective channel length is assumed to deviate by 5\% from the nominal value of 45~nm where the global and local variations are equally weighted \cite{juan2011, juan2012}.
Correlation matrices are computed according to \eref{correlation-function} where the length-scale parameters $\ell_\SE$ and $\ell_\OU$ are set to half the size of the square die.
In the model order reduction technique (see \sref{ie-uncertain-parameters}), the threshold parameter is set to 0.99 preserving 99\% of the variance of the data.
Dynamic power profiles involved in the experiments are based on simulations of randomly generated, \via\ TGFF (v3.5) \cite{dick1998}, applications defined as directed acyclic task graphs.
The floorplans of the platforms are constructed in such a way that the processing elements form regular grids.\footnote{The task graphs of the applications, floorplans of the platforms, configuration of HotSpot, which was used to construct thermal RC circuits for our experiments, are available online at \cite{sources}.}
Time steps of power and temperature traces are set to 1 ms (see \sref{problem-formulation}).
To assess the performance of our polynomial chaos (PC) expansions, we employ a Monte Carlo (MC) sampling technique.
For each sample, \ie, for each outcome of the uncertain parameters, the MC approach solves the initial problem in \eref{fourier-system} numerically using the fourth- and fifth-order Runge-Kutta formulae \cite{press2007} available in MATLAB \cite{matlab}.
