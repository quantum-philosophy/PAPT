In this section, numerical results of the proposed UQ framework for the illustrative example in \sref{illustrative-example} are reported.\footnote{All the experiments are implemented in MATLAB R2012b \cite{matlab} and conducted on a GNU/Linux machine with Intel Core i7 3.4~GHz and 8~GB of RAM.}

The channel length $\Leff$ is assumed to deviate by $5\%$ from the nominal value of 45 nm where the global and local variations are equally weighted \cite{juan2011, juan2012}. The \rvs\ that represent the intra-die variability are computed by the KL expansion applied to \eref{covariance-function} (see \aref{uncertain-parameters}), wherein the correlation length $\corrLength$ is half the size of the die. Dynamic power profiles involved in the experiments are based on simulations of randomly generated applications constructed as directed acyclic task graphs.\footnote{The task graphs of the applications, floorplans of the platforms, configuration of HotSpot, which is used to construct the thermal RC circuits, are available online at \cite{sources}.} The floorplans of the platforms are constructed in such a way that the processing elements form regular grids, as it is the case with, \eg, Alpha 21264 studied in \cite{juan2011}. Time steps of power and temperature traces are set to one millisecond, \ie, $\dt_i = 10^{-3}$~s (see \sref{problem-formulation}). The reference leakage current $I_\leak(\Leff, \T)$ (see \sref{ie-power-model}) is scaled such that the leakage power accounts for about $40\%$ of the total power at high temperatures \cite{liu2007}. To assess the performance of our framework, we employ a Monte Carlo (MC) sampling technique. For each sample draw, the MC approach solves the initial problem numerically using the Dormand-Prince method provided by MATLAB; the procedure combines the well-known fourth- and fifth-order Runge-Kutta formulas \cite{press2007}. Based on theoretical estimations \cite{diaz-emparanza2002} of the MC accuracy, experience from the literature \cite{xiu2010, eldred2009, maitre2010, shen2009}, and our observations, we let the MC approach with a rather moderate number of $10^4$ samples be the etalon for the evaluation of the proposed technique.

The first set of experiments is aimed to identify the accuracy of our framework and, consequently, to find a reasonable value of the polynomial order $\pcorder$ (see \sref{polynomial-chaos}). To this end, three accuracy metrics have been chosen. The first two are the normalized root mean square errors (\nrmse) of expectation and variance of the resulting temperature traces. The third metric is the mean of \nrmses\ of empirical \pdfs\ constructed at each time step for each processing element. The comparison for a quad-core architecture with a dynamic power profile of $\steps = 10^2$ steps is given in \fref{accuracy}, where $\pcorder$ is swept from one to seven. It can be seen that deviations of expectation is small even for $\pcorder = 1$ and is bounded by $1\%$. The \nrmse\ of variance starts from $38\%$ for the first-order PC expansion and drops significantly to less than $5\%$ for the fifth-order PC. The result of the third error estimate, the \nrmse\ of \pdfs, is of particular importance since it allows us to conclude that the \pdfs\ computed by the third-order (and higher) PC expansions are closely following those of the MC technique with a large number of samples. Guided by the above observations, we fix the polynomial order $\pcorder$ to five for the rest of the experiments and state that the error of our technique is bounded by less than $0.5\%$ for expectations, less than $5\%$ for variances, and less than $2\%$ for \pdfs.

Now, we focus on the computational speed. First, we vary the number of processing elements $\cores$. In these experiments, the number of time steps $\steps$ is constant and equal to $10^3$. The results are given in \tref{scaling-cores}. It can be seen that the proposed framework significantly outperforms the MC sampling. For instance, in order to quantify a power profile with $10^3$ steps of a multiprocessor system with 32 cores, the MC approach requires more than 35 hours whereas the proposed framework takes less than 10 seconds.

Finally, we investigate the scaling properties of the proposed UQ framework with respect to the number of time steps $\steps$ in the input power profile, which is directly proportional to the considered time span. The results for a quad-core architecture are given in \tref{scaling-steps}. Due to the long execution time demonstrated by the MC approach, its computational times for high values of $\steps$ are extrapolated based on a smaller number of samples than $10^4$. It can be seen that both methods scale linearly. However, the proposed framework shows a vastly superior performance.
