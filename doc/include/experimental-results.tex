In this section, we report the results of the proposed framework for different configurations of the illustrative example in \sref{illustrative-example}.
All the experiments are conducted on a GNU/Linux machine with Intel Core i7 2.66~GHz and 8~GB of RAM.

% Now we shall describe the default configuration of our experimental setup, which, in the following subsections, will be adjusted according to the purpose of each particular experiment.
We consider a 45-nanometer technological process.
The effective channel length is assumed to deviate by $5\%$ from the nominal value of 45~nm where the global and local variations are equally weighted \cite{juan2011, juan2012}.
Correlation matrices are computed according to \eref{correlation-function} where the length-scale parameters $\ell_\SE$ and $\ell_\OU$ are set to half the size of the die.
In the model order reduction technique (see \sref{ie-uncertain-parameters}), the threshold parameter is set to $0.99$ preserving $99\%$ of the variance of the data.
Dynamic power profiles involved in the experiments are based on simulations of randomly generated, \via\ TGFF (v3.5) \cite{dick1998}, applications defined as directed acyclic task graphs.
The floorplans of the platforms are constructed in such a way that the processing elements form regular grids, as it is the case with, \eg, Alpha 21264 studied in \cite{juan2011}.\footnote{The task graphs of the applications, floorplans of the platforms, configuration of HotSpot, which is used to construct the thermal RC circuits, are available online at \cite{sources}.}
Time steps of power and temperature traces are set to one millisecond (see \sref{problem-formulation}).
To assess the performance of our framework, we employ a Monte Carlo (MC) sampling technique.
For each sample, \ie, for each outcome of the uncertain parameters, the MC approach solves the initial problem in \eref{fourier-system} numerically using the fourth- and fifth-order Runge-Kutta formulae \cite{press2007} implemented in MATLAB \cite{matlab}.
Based on theoretical estimates \cite{diaz-emparanza2002} of the accuracy of MC sampling, experience from the literature \cite{xiu2010, maitre2010, shen2009, eldred2008}, and our observations, we let the MC approach with the number of samples $\nsamples$ equal to $10^4$ be the etalon for the evaluation of the proposed framework.

\subsection{Accuracy vs. Polynomial Order}
\input{include/assets/accuracy.tex}
The first set of experiments is aimed to identify the accuracy of our framework and, consequently, to find a reasonable value of the polynomial order $\pcorder$ for the next experiments (recall \sref{polynomial-chaos}).
To this end, three accuracy metrics have been chosen.
The first two are the normalized root mean square errors (\nrmses) of the expectation and variance of the resulting temperature traces.
The third metric is the mean of \nrmses\ of empirical \pdfs\ constructed at each time step for each processing element.
The comparison for a quad-core architecture with a dynamic power profile of $\nsteps = 10^2$ steps is given in \fref{accuracy}, where $\pcorder$ is swept from one to five.
It can be seen that the deviation of expectation is small even for $\pcorder = 1$ and is bounded by $0.11\%$.
The \nrmse\ of variance starts from $36\%$ for the first-order PC expansion and drops significantly to less than $2\%$ for the third-order PC.
The result of the third error estimate, the \nrmses\ of \pdfs, is of particular importance since it allows us to conclude that the \pdfs\ computed by the fourth-order (and higher) PC expansions are closely following those of the MC technique with a large number of samples.
Guided by the above observations, we fix the polynomial order $\pcorder$ to four for the rest of the experiments and conclude that the error of our technique is bounded by less than $0.2\%$ for expectation and less than $2\%$ for variance and \pdf.

\subsection{Accuracy vs. Spatial Correlations}

\subsection{Computational Speed vs. Processing Elements}
Now we focus on the computational speed.
First, we vary the number of processing elements $\nprocs$, which, in its turn, affects the number of uncertain parameters $\vU(\o)$.
In these experiments, the number of time steps $\nsteps$ is constant and equal to $10^3$.
The results are given in \tref{speed-processing-elements} along with the number of the independent random variables $\vZ(\o)$, $\nvars$, left after the KL-based model order reduction procedure (see \sref{ie-uncertain-parameters}).
\input{include/assets/speed-processing-elements.tex}

It can be seen that the correlations inherent to the fabrication process \cite{cheng2011} open a great possibility for model order reduction.
One can also observe a low slope of the execution time of the MC technique, which exhibits the well-known fact that the workload per one MC sample is independent of the number of stochastic dimensions \cite{maitre2010}.
However, even in high dimensions, the proposed framework significantly outperforms MC sampling. For instance, to quantify a power profile with $10^3$ steps of a system with 32 cores, the MC approach requires more than 40 hours whereas the proposed framework takes less than 10 seconds.

\subsection{Computational Speed vs. Time Spans}
Finally, we investigate the scaling properties of the proposed framework with respect to the duration of the considered time spans, which is directly proportional to the number of steps $\nsteps$ in the power and temperature profiles.
The results for a quad-core architecture are given in \tref{speed-time-spans}.
\input{include/assets/speed-time-spans.tex}

Due to the long execution time demonstrated by the MC approach, its computational times for high values of $\nsteps$ are extrapolated based on a smaller number of samples, \ie, $\nsamples \ll 10^4$.
It can be seen that both methods scale linearly with $\nsteps$. However, the proposed framework shows a vastly superior performance.
