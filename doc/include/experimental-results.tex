Here we take the example from \sref{illustrative-example} and vary the number of processing elements in the system and nominal dynamic power profiles. We demonstrate the scaling properties of the STA and compare them with the MCS.

The framework was implemented in MATLAB R2012a. All the experiments were run on a Linux machine with Intel Core i7-2600 3.4GHz and 8Gb of RAM.
