In this section, we report the results of the proposed framework for different configurations of the illustrative example in \sref{illustrative-example}.
All the experiments are conducted on a GNU/Linux machine with Intel Core i7 2.66~GHz and 8~GB of RAM.

Now we shall elaborate on the default configuration of our experimental setup, which, in the following subsections, will be adjusted according to the purpose of each particular experiment.
We consider a 45-nanometer technological process.
\updated{The effective channel length is assumed to have a nominal value of 45~nm and a standard deviation of 5\% of the nominal value where the global and local variations are equally weighted \cite{juan2011, juan2012}.}
Correlation matrices are computed according to \eref{correlation-function} where the length-scale parameters $\ell_\SE$ and $\ell_\OU$ are set to half the size of the square die.
In the model order reduction technique (see \sref{ie-uncertain-parameters}), the threshold parameter is set to 0.99 preserving 99\% of the variance of the data.
Dynamic power profiles involved in the experiments are based on simulations of randomly generated, \via\ TGFF (v3.5) \cite{dick1998}, applications defined as directed acyclic task graphs.\footnote{\updated{In practice, dynamic power profiles are typically obtained \via\ an adequate system-level cycle-accurate simulator of the architecture of interest.}}
The floorplans of the platforms are constructed in such a way that the processing elements form regular grids.\footnote{The task graphs of the applications, floorplans of the platforms, configuration of HotSpot, which was used to construct thermal RC circuits for our experiments, are available online at \cite{sources}.}
Time steps of power and temperature traces are set to 1~ms (see \sref{problem-formulation}).
As a comparison to our polynomial chaos (PC) expansions, we employ a Monte Carlo (MC) sampling technique.
For each sample, \ie, for each outcome of the uncertain parameters, the MC approach solves the initial problem in \eref{fourier-system} numerically using the fourth- and fifth-order Runge-Kutta formulae \cite{press2007} available in MATLAB \cite{matlab}.
\updated{Since the temperature part of PTA analysis is the main contribution of this work, we shall focus on the on the assessment of temperature profiles.
Note also that, since the two temperature-driven studies \cite{juan2011, juan2012} work under the steady-state assumption, and \cite{juan2011}, in addition, is limited to the maximal temperature (see \sref{prior-work}), a one-to-one comparison with the proposed framework is not possible.}
