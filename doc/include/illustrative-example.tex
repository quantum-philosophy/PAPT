So far we have not made any assumptions regarding the cause of variability of the source term, \ie, the power term, in the thermal system given by \eref{fourier-system}.
In this section, a particular application of the proposed framework.
Specifically, we shall perform stochastic PTA of a multiprocessor platform wherein the uncertainty originates from the leakage power via the variability of the effective channel length due to process variation.
The effective channel length has one of the strongest effects on the leakage current and, consequently, on power and temperature \cite{juan2011, juan2012}; at the same time, this crucial parameter is severely deteriorated by process variation \cite{chandrakasan2001, srivastava2010}.
