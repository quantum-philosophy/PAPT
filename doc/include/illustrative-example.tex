So far, we have not made any assumptions about the sources of variability that result in the deviation of the power consumption and, hence, temperature. In this section, we demonstrate our framework and, therefore, focus on a particular instance, namely, the subthreshold leakage current under the process variation is addressed to model both power and temperature.
