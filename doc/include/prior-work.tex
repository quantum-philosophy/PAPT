To overcome the limitations of deterministic PTA, a number of stochastic PTA techniques have been recently proposed.
A solely power-targeted but temperature-aware solution is proposed in \cite{chandra2010}, which employs Monte Carlo (MC) simulations.
A learning-based approach is presented in \cite{juan2011} to estimate the maximal temperature under the steady-state condition and variability of the leakage current.
Leakage is also considered in \cite{juan2012}, where a statistical model of the steady-state temperature based on Gaussian distributions is derived.
None of the aforementioned techniques attempts to perform stochastic transient PTA and to compute the evolving-in-time probability distribution of temperature.
However, such transient curves are of practical importance.
First of all, certain procedures cannot be undertaken without the knowledge of time-dependent temperature variations, \eg, the reliability optimization based on the thermal-cycling fatigue. Secondly, the constant steady-state temperature assumption, considered, \eg, in \cite{juan2011, juan2012}, can rarely be justified since power profiles are not invariant in reality.
Moreover, the frequently made assumption that power and/or temperature follow \apriori\ known probability distributions---for instance, Gaussian and log-normal distributions are popular choices, as in \cite{juan2012, srivastava2010}---is not realistic due to (a) the strict nonlinearities between the process parameters, power, and temperature; (b) the nonlinear interdependency of temperature and the leakage power \cite{liu2007}.
To illustrate this, we simulated the previously mentioned example $10^4$ times with respect to the distribution of the parameters taken from literature (discussed in \sref{illustrative-example}), and performed kernel density estimation of probability density functions (\pdfs) of the temperature of the four processors at the middle of the time span shown in \fref{motivation-curve} (at time 0.39~s).
The results are depicted in \fref{motivation-pdf}; and it can be seen that they are neither Gaussian nor log-normal.
To conclude, the present stochastic PTA techniques for multiprocessor system design are restricted in use due to one or several of the following traits: based on MC simulations (potentially slow) \cite{chandra2010}, limited to power analysis \cite{chandra2010}, limited to the assumption of the constant steady-state temperature \cite{juan2011, juan2012}, exclusive focus on the maximal temperature \cite{juan2011}, \apriori\ chosen distributions of power and temperature \cite{juan2012, srivastava2010}.
Consequently, there is a lack of flexible stochastic PTA techniques, which we aim to fulfill.

A straightforward approach to analyze a stochastic system is MC sampling coupled with a deterministic simulator.
The major problem with MC sampling is the low rate of convergence, \eg, the mean value converges as $\mcsamples^{-\ifrac{1}{2}}$ where $\mcsamples$ is the number of samples \cite{xiu2010, maitre2010}.
This means that, in order to get an additional decimal point of accuracy, one has to obtain hundred times more samples.
Each such sample implies a complete realization of the whole system; therefore, MC-based methods are typically slow and often infeasible since the number of needed simulations can be extremely large \cite{diaz-emparanza2002}.

Attractive alternatives to MC sampling are spectral methods \cite{xiu2010, maitre2010} such as the generalized polynomial chaos (PC), which is able to construct easy-to-analyze representations of system responses to stochastic inputs.
PC is commonly accompanied by another spectral method known as the Karhunen-Lo\`{e}ve (KL) expansion \cite{ghanem1991}. KL is useful as a technique for reduction of the number of uncertain parameters and, hence, of the resulting computational costs.
In \cite{shen2009}, PC based on Hermite polynomials is employed to estimate the full-chip leakage.
The KL expansion is used in \cite{bhardwaj2006} to calculate the leakage current of electrical circuits.
An analysis of the voltage response of power grids is carried out in \cite{ghanta2006}, where the PC and KL expansions are jointly utilized.

The contribution of this paper is in the following: we develop, for the first time, a framework for UQ of transient power and temperature variations of multiprocessor systems that depend on a number of uncertain parameters.
The framework is flexible in modeling diverse probability distributions, specified by the user, of the parameters, and there are no assumptions on the distributions of the resulting power and temperature traces, as these distributions are unlikely to be known \apriori.
Furthermore, our technique is capable of capturing arbitrary joint effects of the uncertain parameters on the system since the parameters are introduced into the model as a ``black box'', which is also defined by the user.
The framework produces the power and temperature profiles of the system given as polynomials of \rvs; the expressions are straightforward to be further analyzed. We will illustrate the framework considering one of the most important parameters affected by process variation: the subthreshold leakage current.
Note, however, that our approach is not bounded to any particular source of variability and, apart from the process-related variations, can be applied to other uncertainties such as those due to the environment, \ie, fluctuations of the supply voltage, ambient temperature, \etc
