Given a thermal specification of the platform $\system$ (see \sref{architecture-model}), an equivalent thermal RC circuit with $\nodes$ thermal nodes is constructed \cite{kreith2000}. The structure of the circuit depends on the intended level of details, which defines the resulting accuracy. The thermal behavior of the circuit is modeled with the following system of differential-algebraic equations (DAEs):
\begin{subnumcases}{\elabel{fourier-system-original}}
  \mC \frac{d\vTI(\t, \o)}{d\t} + \mG \vTI(\t, \o) = \mM \vP(\t, \o) \elabel{fourier-original} \\
  \vTO(\t, \o) = \mM^T \vTI(\t, \o) + \vTO_\amb
\end{subnumcases}
where $\mC, \mG \in \real^{\nodes \times \nodes}$ are a diagonal matrix of the thermal capacitance and a symmetric, positive-definite matrix of the thermal conductance, respectively; $\vTI \in \real^\nodes$ is the vector the difference between the temperature of the thermal nodes and the ambient temperature; $\vP \in \real^\cores$ and $\mM \in \real^{\nodes \times \cores}$ are the input vector of power (see \eref{power-model}) and its mapping matrix to the thermal nodes; $\vTO \in \real^\cores$ is the temperature vector of the processing elements, and $\vTO_\amb \in \real^\cores$ is the vector of the ambient temperature. Without loss of generality, the last is modeled as a deterministic variable. For convenience, we perform an auxiliary transformation of \eref{fourier-system-original} \cite{ukhov2012}. Let $\vX = \mC^\ifrac{1}{2} \vTI$, $\mA = -\mC^{-\ifrac{1}{2}} \mG \mC^{-\ifrac{1}{2}}$, and $\mB = \mC^{-\ifrac{1}{2}} \mM$, then
\begin{subnumcases}{\elabel{fourier-system}}
  \frac{d\vX(\t, \o)}{d\t} = \mA \vX(\t, \o) + \mB \vP(\t, \o) \elabel{fourier-de} \\
  \vTO(\t, \o) = \mB^T \vX(\t, \o) + \vTO_\amb \elabel{fourier-output}
\end{subnumcases}
where the coefficient matrix $\mA$ preserves the symmetry and positive-definiteness of $\mG$. In general, \eref{fourier-de} is a nonlinear system of differential equations due to $\vP(\t, \o)$, which has an arbitrary dependency on temperature (see \eref{power-model}). Hence, there are no closed-form solutions to \eref{fourier-de}.

The time intervals $\{ \dt_i \}_{i = 1}^{\steps}$ of the input profile $\prof{\mP_\dyn}$ are assumed to be short enough such that the total power can be approximated by a constant within one interval. In this case, \eref{fourier-de} is a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which can be solved analytically. The solution is
\begin{equation} \elabel{ode-solution}
  \vX(\t, \o) = \mE(\t) \vX(0, \o) + \mD(\t) \vP(0, \o)
\end{equation}
where $\t \in [0, \dt]$, $\vP(0, \o)$ is the power dissipation at the beginning of the time interval with respect to the corresponding temperature, and
\begin{align*}
  & \mE(\t) = e^{\mA \t} \in \real^{\nodes \times \nodes} \\
  & \mD(\t) = \mA^{-1} (e^{\mA \t} - \mI) \mB \in \real^{\nodes \times \cores}
\end{align*}
As shown in \cite{ukhov2012}, $\mE$ and $\mD$ can be efficiently computed using a factorization of $\mA$, which needs to be performed only once for a particular thermal circuit. Taking into consideration all $\steps$ time intervals of $\prof{\mP_\dyn}$, we obtain the following recurrent expression for $k \in \{ 1, \dotsc, \steps \}$:
\begin{equation} \elabel{recurrence}
  \vX_k(\t, \o) = \mE(\t) \vX_k(0, \o) + \mD(\t) \vP_k(0, \o)
\end{equation}
where $\t \in [ 0, \dt_k ]$ and
\begin{align*}
  & \vX_0(0, \o) = \vZero & \vX_k(0, \o) = \vX_{k - 1}(\dt_{k - 1}, \o)
\end{align*}
Here, without loss of generality, we let the initial temperature be equal to the ambient temperature. In the deterministic case, the recurrence in \eref{recurrence} can be readily employed to perform the deterministic transient PTA \cite{ukhov2012}. In the stochastic case, however, where $\vX_k(\t, \o)$, $\vTO_k(\t, \o)$, and $\vP_k(\t, \o)$ are probabilistic quantities, a straight-forward analysis of \eref{recurrence} is problematic to undertake due to the presence of nonlinear correlations between and within successive steps.
