Given the platform description $\system$ (see \sref{architecture-model}), an equivalent thermal RC circuit with $\nodes$ \definition{thermal nodes} is constructed \cite{kreith2000}. The structure of the circuit depends on the intended level of details defining the accuracy of the final model.

The thermal behaviour of the circuit is modeled with the following system of differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) with the state-space dimension equal to $\nodes$:
\begin{align} \elabel{fourier-original}
  \left\{
    \begin{array}{l}
      \mC \frac{d\vTI(\t, \o)}{d\t} + \mG \vTI(\t, \o) = \mM \vP(\t, \vTO(\t, \o), \o) \\
      \vTO(\t, \o) = \mM^T \vTI(\t, \o) + \vTO_\amb
    \end{array}
  \right.
\end{align}
$\mC, \mG \in \real^{\nodes \times \nodes}$ are the matrices of the thermal capacitance and conductance, respectively. $\mC$ is a diagonal matrix with positive elements, and $\mG$ is a symmetric, positive-definite matrix. $\vTI \in \real^\nodes$ is the state vector of the system, which corresponds to the difference between the temperature of the thermal nodes and the ambient temperature. $\vP \in \real^\cores$ is the input vector of the power dissipation of the processing elements (see \eref{power-model}), and $\mM \in \real^{\nodes \times \cores}$ is its mapping matrix to the thermal nodes. $\vTO \in \real^\cores$ is the output vector of the system, which is the temperature of the processing elements. Finally, $\vTO_\amb \in \real^\cores$ is the vector of the ambient temperature, which, for clarity of presentation and without loss of generality, we model as a deterministic variable.

For convenience, we perform an auxiliary transformation \cite{ukhov2012} of the original system given by \eref{fourier-original}. Let $\vX = \mC^\frac{1}{2} \vTI$, $\mA = \mC^\frac{1}{2} \mG \mC^\frac{1}{2}$, and $\mB = \mC^\frac{1}{2} \mM$, then\footnote{Since $\mC$ is diagonal, the transformation is cheat to undertake.}
\begin{align} \elabel{fourier}
  \left\{
    \begin{array}{l}
      \frac{d\vX(\t, \o)}{d\t} = \mA \vX(\t, \o) + \mB \vP(\t, \vTO(\t, \o), \o) \\
      \vTO(\t, \o) = \mB^T \vX(\t, \o) + \vTO_\amb
    \end{array}
  \right.
\end{align}
where $\vX$ is the new state vector. It should be noted that the coefficient matrix $\mA$ preserves the  symmetry and positive-definiteness of $\mG$.
