We presented a framework for transient power-temperature analysis (PTA) of
electronic systems under process variation. Additional details about this work
can be found in \cite{ukhov2014}, which includes an illustrative application of
the framework and a comparison with Monte Carlo sampling. The comparison
confirms the efficiency of our approach in terms of both accuracy and speed. The
reduced execution times, by up to five orders of magnitude, implied by the
proposed framework allow for PTA to be efficiently performed inside design space
exploration loops aimed at, \eg, energy and reliability optimization with
temperature-related constraints under process variation.
