Electronic system design based on deterministic techniques for power-temperature
analysis is, in the context of current and future technologies, both unreliable
and inefficient since the presence of uncertainty, in particular, due to process
variation, is disregarded. In this work, we propose a flexible probabilistic
framework targeted at the quantification of the transient power and temperature
variations of an electronic system. The framework is capable of modeling diverse
probability laws of the underlying uncertain parameters and arbitrary
dependencies of the system on such parameters. For the considered system, under
a given workload, our technique delivers analytical representations of the
corresponding stochastic power and temperature profiles. These representations
allow for a computationally efficient estimation of the probability
distributions and accompanying quantities of the power and temperature
characteristics of the system.
