As stated in \sref{problem-formulation}, the user of the framework is supposed
to decide on the power model for the system under consideration. Such a model
can be generally expressed as the following $\nprocs$-dimensional functional
$\oPower$:
\begin{equation} \elabel{power-model}
  \vP(\t, \vU) = \oPower{\t, \vTO(\t, \vU), \vU}
\end{equation}
where $\nprocs$ is the number of processing elements in the system, and $\vP(\t,
\vU) \in \real^\nprocs$ and $\vTO(\t, \vU) \in \real^\nprocs$ are random vectors
of power and temperature, respectively, at time $\t$.
