Independence of the parameters is a prerequisite for PC expansions. In general,
however, $\vU$ can be correlated and, therefore, should be preprocessed in order
to fulfill the requirement. To this end, an adequate probability transformation
should be undertaken \cite{eldred2008}. Denote such a transformation by $\vU =
\oTransform{\vZ}$, which relates the $\nparams$ dependent uncertain parameters
$\vU$ with $\nvars$ independent random variables $\vZ$.

Apart from the extraction of the independent parameters $\vZ$, an essential
operation at this stage is model order reduction since the number of stochastic
dimensions of the problem directly impacts the complexity of the rest of the
computations. The intuition is that, due to the correlations possessed by the
random variables in $\vU$, some of them can be harmlessly replaced by
combinations of the rest, leading to a smaller number of the random variables in
$\vZ$.
